# 7.x Upgrade Guide

## Breaking changes

### react-is.isForwardRef() removed

The usage of `react-is.isForwardRef()` was removed from `getWidget.tsx` because React 19 no longer supports this function. ForwardRef components are now detected using `ReactIs.isValidElementType()`, which provides a robust check for all valid React component types.

This change should be transparent to most users, as the widget detection logic now properly handles:

- Regular function components
- Memoized components (`React.memo`)
- ForwardRef components (`React.forwardRef`)
- Other exotic React components
