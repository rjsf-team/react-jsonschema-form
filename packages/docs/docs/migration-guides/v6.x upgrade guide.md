# 6.x Upgrade Guide

## Breaking changes

### Theme removals

The following themes were removed due to duplication of a framework with a newer theme

#### bootstrap-4

The older `bootstrap-4` theme has been removed in favor of the `react-bootstrap` theme

#### fluent-ui

The older `fluent-ui` theme has been removed in favor of the `fluentui-rc` theme

#### material-ui

The older `material-ui` theme has been removed in favor of the `mui` theme

#### @mui version 5

The `mui` theme no longer supports `@mui` version 5 due to the adoption of breaking changes in version 6

### Node support

Version 6 is dropping official support for Node 14, 16, and 18 as they are no longer a [maintained version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Please use Node 22 when making any changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
All PR and branch builds are running against Node 20 and 22.

### React version

RJSF is no longer actively supporting React version < 16.14.x.
React 18 is officially supported on all the themes where the underlying theme library also supports React 18.

React 19 support is expected before the end of beta (although several developers have already upgraded with no problems).

### New packages

There is one new packages added in RJSF version 6:

- `@rjsf/react-bootstrap`: This is rename of the `bootstrap-4` theme with an upgrade to the latest version of `react-bootstrap`

### Templates BREAKING CHANGES

#### ArrayFieldTemplateItemType

The type `ArrayFieldTemplateItemType` was deprecated in favor of the `ArrayFieldItemTemplateType` type, which matches the type naming pattern properly.

#### ArrayFieldItemTemplate

The `ArrayFieldItemTemplateType` was refactored to extract the following props into out a new `ArrayFieldItemButtonsTemplateType`:

- `canAdd`: A boolean value stating whether new items can be added to the array.
- `hasCopy`: A boolean value stating whether the array item can be copied.
- `hasMoveDown`: A boolean value stating whether the array item can be moved down.
- `hasMoveUp`: A boolean value stating whether the array item can be moved up.
- `hasRemove`: A boolean value stating whether the array item can be removed.
- `onAddIndexClick: (index) => (event?) => void`: Returns a function that adds a new item at `index`.
- `onDropIndexClick: (index) => (event?) => void`: Returns a function that removes the item at `index`.
- `onReorderClick: (index, newIndex) => (event?) => void`: Returns a function that swaps the items at `index` with `newIndex`.

A new `buttonsProps` prop was added of the type `ArrayFieldItemButtonsTemplateType`

This new type was then used to create a new `ArrayFieldItemButtonsTemplate` in the `Registry.templates`.
See [ArrayFieldItemButtonTemplate](../advanced-customization/custom-templates.md#arrayfielditembuttontemplate)

If you have implemented your own `ArrayFieldItemTemplate` or `ArrayField` then you will have to account for these changes.

#### GridTemplate

A new, theme-dependent template `GridTemplate` was added to support the new layout feature and must be provided if you are building your own `registry.templates` rather than overloading them via the `templates` props.
