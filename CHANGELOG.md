INSTRUCTIONS:

For each PR, add a changelog entry that describes what your PR does. Add it to the heading
for the appropriate package it modifies and include it in this format:
- [Description] ([Link to PR])

If your PR affects multiple packages, list it multiple times under headings for each package.
If it affects more general things such as dependency updates or non-package-specific changes,
add it under a "Dev / docs / playground" section.

You should also update the heading of the latest (upcoming) version if your PR change merits
it according to semantic versioning. For example, if your PR adds a breaking change, then you
should change the heading of the (upcoming) version to include a major version bump.

## @rjsf/utils
- Beta-only potentially BREAKING CHANGE: Changed all types that directly or indirectly defined `schema`/`rootSchema` to add the generic `S extends StrictRJSFSchema = RJSFSchema` and use `S` as the type for them.
  - `StrictRJSFSchema` was added as the alias to `JSON7Schema` and `RJSFSchema` was modified to be `StrictRJSFSchema & GenericObjectType`

- Updated the `validation` guide to document the new `AjvClass` prop on `CustomValidatorOptionsType` and mentioning the deprecation of `@rjsf/validator-ajv6`
- Updated the playground to add support for using the AJV 8 validator with the `draft-2019-09` and `draft-2020-12` schemas and to make the `AJV8` validator the default validator, marking `AJV6` as deprecated
- Updated all the documentation to switch to Typescript notation where missing along with switching to using the `@rjsf/validator-ajv8` validator as the default
- Added a way of doing a raw Ajv validation in the playground to determine whether an issue is with RJSF or Ajv
